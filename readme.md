readme file for repscrap, a 3d printer

The intention here is to use the parts from 2 CR10 printers I had to create a modern printer.

My plan for it includes:

    A H-Bot kinematic system (coreXY in future maybe, but keeping it simple for now)
    Flying gantry
    Mains powered heated bed
    Eddy current sensor for bed levelling (probably the BTT eddy)
    A toolhead board (the BTT EBB42 probably)

At the moment I have completed:

    Bed (taken from my modified CR10 which already included a mains heated bed)
    Frame (using extrusion from both CR10s and cutom designed brackets for all 8 corners)

Next up is

    The Y axis gantries 

This picture is old and doesn't include the latest designs for the frame, but it does include a rather handsome picture of Hamish so it's staying.
